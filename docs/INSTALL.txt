collective.generic.devmode Installation
=================================================================================

To install collective.generic.devmode into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:

 * When you're reading this you have probably already run ::

   ``easy_install collective.generic.devmode``.

   Find out how to install setuptools (and EasyInstall) here: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

 * If you are using Zope 2.9 (not 2.10), get `pythonproducts`_ and install it
   via::

       python setup.py install --home /path/to/instance

   into your Zope instance.

.. _pythonproducts: http://plone.org/products/pythonproducts


Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

 * Add ``collective.generic.devmode`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::

    [buildout]
    ...
    [zopepy]
    eggs =
        ${buildout:eggs}
        collective.generic.devmode
    scripts = cg.devmode



 * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

    $ ./bin/buildout
